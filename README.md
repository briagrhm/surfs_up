This temperature difference is significant. The count of temperatures used to obtain the mean temperatures and the minimum temperatures differ for December and June. June had a count of 1700 temperatures and December had a count of 1517 temperatures. 

## Summary
Business should be able to sustiain year round from the analysis that was collected on the previous years weather. With the average temperatures being close together it should not be a problem for the visitors to surf and enjoy ice cream. The only reason business may differ a little in December may be because of the low minimum temperature but this just may mean that surfers are only going to surf at peak temperatures during the day. Other analysis that could be done is looking at different times of the day that have peak temperatures more desirable for surfing. This could help determine whether or not the temperatures will last long enough to turn a profit during the day in the colder months. Also, it could help with advising visitors about the best times to surf. Looking at other months to determine when the minimum temperature falls drastically could help with figuring out the months that business may slow down a little.
